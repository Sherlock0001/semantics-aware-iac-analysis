One day, John was playing a video game when he came across a glitch. This glitch allowed him to do something that was not supposed to be possible in the game. John was very excited, and he decided to share his discovery with his friends. His friends were also very excited, and they started to play the game in a way that was not supposed to be possible. They were having a lot of fun, and they were getting better and better at the game. One day, John’s friends decided to share their discovery with other people. They started to tell people about the glitch, and they started to teach people how to use it. Soon, the glitch became very popular, and people all over the world were using it to play the game in a way that was not supposed to be possible. John was very proud of his friends, and he was happy that they were able to share their discovery with the world. He was also happy that people were having so much fun with the game. John knew that the glitch was not supposed to be there, and he knew that it was not supposed to be possible.
